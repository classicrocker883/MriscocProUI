        ## Before Requesting a Feature

        - Read and understand Marlin's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/master/.github/code_of_conduct.md). You are expected to comply with it, including treating everyone with respect.

        - Check the latest [branch](https://github.com/classicrocker883/MRiscoCProUI) to see if the feature already exists.

        - Before you proceed, please consider all aspects necessary to make it into a firmware feature, or what may be involved building and testing it before it becomes fully ulilized in the next updated release.
        Also think if it may be better suited for a slicer or host feature.
